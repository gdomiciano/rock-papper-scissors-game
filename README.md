# rock-papper-scisors-game
Little game project with the goal to create a user vs computer game

Copy this file as a start point for your logic: https://github.com/gdomiciano/rock-papper-scissors-game/blob/start-point/game.js

Create an `index.html` that allows the user to choose an option among rock, paper and scissors and a button to play against the computer.

When for each time the user press the button the game should:
* Get the user choice
* Compare the user choice with the computer choice
* Define who is the winner (computer or user)
* Show a message of who won the game
